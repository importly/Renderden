#include "../src/main.cpp"
/*
Later, we should be able to include a header, that contains our
API methods. We need to change the name of main.cpp to Renderden.cpp, Renderden.h,
as this is the file that will get executed, accessing our functions.
Additionally, we should make Renderden.h, (or cpp) a namespace, so
people can use our namespace, and access the functions.

ex: using namespace Renderden;

rdDrawTriangle();
