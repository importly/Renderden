# Renderden
A simple OpenGL engine 

Renderden is a small OpenGL engine project I have been working on. It doesn't have anything special yet but it is a WIP.

#Building
To build, you must add in the Include and Lib folders and link them to the compiler. After that, add in the glad.c file to the src folder because the Engine runs on glad. When you are done, running the project should open a window.a
